// Texture Filter Parameters Explained:
//---------------------------------------------------------------------------
/*
    The value of parameter number three depends on whether you are setting a 
    GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER variable or a GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER variable. 
    Here are the possible combinations:

    When the second parameter is GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER, parameter three can be:
        GL_NEAREST_MIPMAP_NEAREST
        GL_LINEAR_MIPMAP_NEAREST
        GL_NEAREST_MIPMAP_LINEAR
        GL_LINEAR_MIPMAP_LINEAR
        GL_NEAREST
        GL_LINEAR
    When the second parameter is GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER, parameter three can be:
        GL_LINEAR
        GL_NEAREST

The filter value set for GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER is used whenever a surface is 
rendered with smaller dimensions than its corresponding texture bitmap 
(far away objects). Whereas the filter value for GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER is used in 
the exact opposite case – a surface is bigger than the texture being applied (near objects).

There are more options for the min filter because it can potentially have mipmapping. 
However, it wouldn’t make sense to apply mipmapping to the mag filter since close-up 
objects don’t need it in the first place. Here’s a list of all the possible combinations 
and how they impact what is rendered (first constant in the left-most column is the near 
object filter [mag]; second constant is the far object filter [min]):
