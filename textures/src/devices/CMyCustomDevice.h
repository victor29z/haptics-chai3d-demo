    \ingroup    devices  

    \brief
    cMyCustomDevice provides a basic template which allows to very easily
    interface CHAI3D to your own custom haptic device. \n\n

    Simply follow the 12 commented step in file CMyCustomDevice.cpp 
    and complete the code accordingly.
    Depending of the numbers of degrees of freedom of your device, not
    all methods may need to be implemented. For instance, if your device
    does not provide any rotation degrees of freedom, simply ignore
    the getRotation() method. Default values will be returned correctly
    if these are not implemented on your device. In the case of rotations
    for instance, the identity matrix is returned.\n\n

    You may also rename this class in which case you will also want to
    customize the haptics handler to automatically detect your device.
    Please consult method update() of the cHapticDeviceHandler class
    which is located in file CHapticDeviceHandler.cpp .
    Simply see how the haptic device handler already looks for
    device of type cMyCustomDevice.\n\n

    If you are encounting any problems with your implementation, check 
    for instance file cDeltaDevices.cpp which implement supports for the 
    delta(0)  and omega(0)  haptic devices. In order to verify the implementation
    use the 01-device example to get started. Example 11-effects is a great
    demo to verify how basic haptic effects may behave with you haptic
    devices. If you do encounter vibrations or instabilities, try reducing
    the maximum stiffness supported by your device 
    (see STEP1 in file CMyCustomDevice.cpp).\n
    
    Make  sure that your device is also communicating fast enough with 
    your computer. Ideally the communication period should take less 
    than 1ms in order to reach a desired update rate of at least 1000Hz.
    Problems can typicaly occur when using a slow serial port (RS232) for
    instance.\n
